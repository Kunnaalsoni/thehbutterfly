I'm not like an ordinary world. <br>
I have my madness, <br>
I live in another dimension and <br>
I do not have time for things that have no soul."<br></b>

                        <p>Experiencing human life is a unique experience full of learning as the human subsistence is a distinctive unification of matter and spirit that results in immense complexity. Without embracing 'Transformative Spirituality', we
                            cannot experience spiritual enlightenment. To navigate through the complicated threads of human existence, one needs to grasp the myriad dimensions of life. Here, are they:-</p>
                        - The first dimension is our physical existence enveloped in the human form. This dimension encompasses personality, family, action, work, etc.<br><br> - The second dimension is a dimension encompassing senses, emotions and experience.
                        <br><br> - The third dimension is a dimension wherein we get in touch with life through our desire for accomplishment.<br><br> - The fourth dimension governs the dimension of emotions and relationships. <br><br> - The fifth dimension
                        is a dimension meant to be experienced through the communication centre, enabling us to express and manifest. <br><br> - The sixth dimension is a dimension wherein we approach life through thinking centre to awaken our understanding
                        acumen, wisdom via "Question" technique.<br><br> - The seventh dimension is a dimension of a higher consciousness level. Oneness, peace and love are a few prime attributes of this dimension. Astral projection and Telepathy originate
                        and become the main communication source between souls. <br><br> - The Eight Dimension is an amalgamation of the balance of the traits of 6th and 7th dimension and is dominated by the selflessness. <br><br> - The Ninth dimension
                        is a dimension wherein a soul strives to make advancement to experience superior dimensional frequency to connect to the essence of the frequency of creator (God).<br><br> - The tenth dimension is a dimension that enables one to
                        embark on the greatest path empowered with the higher understanding, resulting in never-end bliss. <br><br> - The eleventh dimension is a dimension of archangels and a soul strives to awaken the collective consciousness. <br><br>                        - The Twelfth dimension is a dimension governed by the Godliest form that has been already half merged with the divine energy. You can figure out about the state of current dimension through decoding your emotions. Superior level
                        of bliss suggests that you are operating in a higher dimension. <br><br> "We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are
                        mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made of layers, cells, constellations."<br><br> Since her first encounter with depression
                        some 10 years back when she was a naive human, she has grown much wiser. Her perspective about the world around her continues to change and at times, she is compelled to believe that the less-educated people are somewhat more content
                        than those of highly educated ones. Less privileged people are somewhat more sensitive than those of privileged ones. What we are being taught in school and home does not necessarily depict the realism in an ideal manner. During
                        her toughest phases, she could not recall any math equation or a chemical formula that did prove to be of any help to her. If something that could lend her a sense of comfort, were a few literary verses from Hindi & English:-<br><br>
                        <p class="uk-text-center uk-text-bold color-pink">The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br> But I have promises to keep,<br> And miles to go before I sleep,<br> And miles to go before I sleep."<br> "I shall be telling this with a sigh<br> Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br> Two
                            roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br> I took the one less traveled by,<br> And that has made all the difference."</p>
                        From Bhagavad Gita to Paulo Coelho novels to fictions like 'Thousands Splendid Suns' imparted her strength to cope up with her turbulent situations. <br> Quotes like "When I had nothing to lose, I had everything. When I stopped
                        being who I am, I found myself." kept on infusing courage does not matter in what amount. Music too played a significant role in speeding up the entire healing process, especially, the spiritual. <br><br> She was being taught in
                        the school and her home that no matter what, one must learn to be considerate, forgiving, respectful, and polite and one must strive to acquire all the positive qualities. Like an obedient child, she went on to acquire one positive
                        quality after another.
                        <p> Nevertheless, one day she woke up to altogether a different world rather a world that she could not relate to her previous world. Same kind and encouraging people turned unkind. Despair combined with bewilderment led her to a chaotic
                            state almost on the verge of losing her mental sanity because all she had learnt throughout the life so far was to perceive things as per one dimension i.e. Good and only good.</p> She tried coping up with a chaotic state but
                        she failed until she began experimenting with the second dimension i.e. acknowledging the evil. It has been a decade and she is leading a life devoid of chaos as she has understood the dynamism of Triquetra: The third dimension.
                        "Our way of thinking is shaped by dualism, Entrance-Exit. Black-White. Good-Evil, Everything appears to us as opposite pairs. But that is wrong. Have you ever heard of the Triquetra?" that suggests that "Nothing is complete without
                        the third dimension. There isn't just only going up and down. There's a center as well.."
                        <p>
                            Generally, we humans do pursue dualism but the kind of world we live in needs us to be more aware of the third dimension where nothing is sheer white or absolute black. The best memories are the one wherein we have lent our shoulder to someone to cry
                            or have been there to listen to someone's woes. Never make peace with your self-respect on the name of blood bonds until your heart can forgive genuinely. Blood bonds may be the trickiest things to deal with as there remains
                            the maximum scope for manipulation in terms of emotions. Here, get hold of all the learning inspired by the "Triquetra: Third dimension" that may help you in navigating through your life. </p>

                        <p>- You need not be strong all the times, it is extremely important to learn to be vulnerable because, at times, when the constant efforts to put up a brave face has made you exhausted like never before, it is time to embrace 'vulnerability'
                            to rejuvenate your soul to bounce back with superior energy.</p>

                        <p>- Never trust people based on certain criteria. Adopt an unbiased outlook to judge them including the 'Blood bonds' because when someone breaks your trust most unimaginably, it leaves a permanent scar on your psyche that may take
                            lifetimes to heal. </p>

                        <p>- There is a difference between being 'Kind' and being 'Wise Kind' because stumbling upon a few manipulative people may forbid you to persist with your generosity. Be kind but at the same time, be vigilant and pay attention to
                            the body language, facial expressions and tone of people because paying attention will truly be worth. </p>

                        <p> - Genuine friendship is the most valuable asset that one can have in life. People do make myriad kinds of investments that are fluctuating in nature but a genuine friendship is the most valuable investment to be made. Friends do
                            play the most important role in one's life. One may not have a luxury life but despite that one can be happy in the company of friends. Again, maintaining friendship is an extremely demanding process but once the rock-solid
                            foundation is in a place, a true friendship knows how to take care of itself. Also, remember, never judge the quality of a friendship based upon the number of years it has completed successfully. The quality of friendship is
                            determined by its intentions. This learning will come to your rescue when you will discover that whom you considered a friend for more than a decade, did not stand by you, during your toughest moment. While making friends,
                            choose character and integrity over any other quality. </p>

                        <p>- In the end, material success does matter a lot in life in but that should not be the ultimate goal because accomplishing something meaningful in the context of spirituality emphasizing on compassion too is indeed the equally
